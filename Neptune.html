    <h4 id="subheading">Structure</h4>
    <p id="paragraph">This planet is an ice giant in the outer solar system. Most of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of water, methane, and ammonia, and a small, rocky core. Scientists think there might be an ocean of super hot water under the planet’s cold clouds that is contained by the incredibly high pressure of this planet.
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="subheading">Surface</h4>
    <p id="paragraph">This planet doesn’t have a solid surface. Its atmosphere extends to great depths, gradually merging into water and other melted ices over a heavier, solid core.</p>
    
    <h4 id="subheading">Atmosphere</h4>
    <p id="paragraph">The atmosphere of this planet is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium with just a little bit of methane. Winds can be nine times stronger than Earth's as they whip clouds of frozen methane across the planet.
