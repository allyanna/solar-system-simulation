    <h4 id="subheading">Structure</h4>
    <p id="paragraph">This planet is made of mostly hydrogen and helium glasses and liquids. It is still unclear if it has a central core of solid material or if it may just be a thick, super-hot and dense soup.</p>
    
    <h4 id="subheading">Surface</h4>
    <p id="paragraph">As a gas giant, this planet doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids. Deep in the atmosphere, pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid giving it an ocean made of hydrogen.</p>
    
    <h4 id="subheading">Atmosphere</h4>
    <p id="paragraph">This planet likely has three distinct cloud layers. The top cloud layer is probably made of ammonia ice, while the middle layer is likely made of ammonium hydrosulfide crystals. The innermost layer may be made of water ice and vapor. The planet’s fast rotation creates strong jet streams, separating its clouds into dark belts and bright zones across long stretches.</p>
