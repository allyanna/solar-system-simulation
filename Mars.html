    <h4 id="subheading">Structure</h4>
    <p id="paragraph">This planet as a dense core at its center made of iron, 
      nickel and sulfur. Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle, and above that, 
      it has a crust made of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium and potassium.</p>
    
    <h4 id="subheading">Surface</h4>
    <p id="paragraph">This planet has a desert looking landscape with mountains, 
      volcanoes, impact craters, and canyons. It appears to have had a watery past, with ancient 
      river valley networks, deltas and lake beds, but today water is only found in the form of 
      water-ice just under the surface in the polar regions.</p>
    
    <h4 id="subheading">Atmosphere</h4>
    <p id="paragraph">This planet has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen 
      and argon gases. It doesn't offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites, 
      asteroids and comets. Occasionally, dust storms form that cover much of the planet and can take 
      months before all the dust settles. </p>

    <h4 id="subheading">Length of Day</h4>
    <p id="paragraph">24.6 hours<p>
