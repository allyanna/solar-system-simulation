    <h4 id="subheading">Structure</h4>
    <p id="paragraph">This planet is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. At it’s center is a dense core of metals like iron and nickel surrounded by rocky material and other compounds solidified by the intense pressure and heat. It is enveloped by liquid metallic hydrogen inside a layer of liquid</p>
    
    <h4 id="subheading">Surface</h4>
    <p id="paragraph">As a gas giant, this planet doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids. Deep in the atmosphere, pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid giving it an ocean made of hydrogen.</p>
    
    <h4 id="subheading">Atmosphere</h4>
    <p id="paragraph">This planet is is blanketed with clouds that appear as faint stripes, jet streams and storms.The north pole has an interesting atmospheric feature—a six-sided jet stream. There is no weather feature like it anywhere else in the solar system.</p>
